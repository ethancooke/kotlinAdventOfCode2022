# kotlinAdventOfCode2022

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ethancooke][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, ethancooke is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.*

*I'm going to try out chatgpt4 ability to solve aoc with Kotlin code. Not trying to leader board, doing this exercise 1 year after the event.

This is for learning. :)

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
